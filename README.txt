PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!

In order to compile the source files, simply type in "make" and the files, "start1.h" and "start1.cpp", should compile. "start1.h.gch" is just a compressed version of "start1.h"
that the GNU Compiler produces to compile more quickly, so do not modify or delete it.

When the files have been compiled, type in "./Student" to run the program. When you are finished with the program, type in "make clean" to delete all executable files.
